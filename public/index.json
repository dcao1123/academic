There are numerous web site building platforms out there, like Wix or WordPress. Of those sites, WordPress is the most popular. It provides you a suite of serve to create a beautiful web site, either blog or e-commence site. Using WordPress, you do not need to know Programming like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\nHowever, all those service comes with some of costs despite the cost may be minimal. You need to spend some to buy domain name and pay hosting service provider to host your web site. If you are in the business, you also need to pay for the business email address. if it is the first time for you build site and with purpose of sharing your knowledge, it is not worth doing that way. More importantly, those website building service would hide the coding from you, which is not desirable for programmers.\nIt had appeared to me that there are quite a few of coding languages you need to master before you can put up a nice web site in the internet. For example, basic languages include HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Regarding the back-end language, you probably need to learn of these PHP, Java or Python. But it become so easy to create a web site when you use blogdown . There is no need to buy domain name and pay hosting service. With simply 4 steps under 10 minutes, you can make your professional web site available to the world.\nBelow I am going to use 4 steps to show how to create a skeleton of website using Blogdown in R Studio. assuming you are a programmer and have a knowledge of R.\nSoftware Requirements\rAssume you have already installed R (https://www.r-project.org) [@R-base] and the RStudio IDE (https://www.rstudio.com). then do the following:\nInstall package Blogdown in RStudio IDE\rinstall package Hugo\r\r## Install from CRAN\rinstall.packages(\u0026#39;blogdown\u0026#39;) ## Or, install from GitHub\rif (!requireNamespace(\u0026quot;devtools\u0026quot;)) install.packages(\u0026#39;devtools\u0026#39;)\rdevtools::install_github(\u0026#39;rstudio/blogdown\u0026#39;)\rblogdown::install_hugo()\rAssume that you already have an GitHub account. If you do not have the account, go to the GitHub https://github.com/ and set up your account. It is free. Next, I am going to use 4 steps to show how to put up a skeleton of web site that is beautiful enough for you to deploy to the internet. Based on the skeleton website, you can work on R code (Markdown) to add contents to and modify your site continuously.\n\rStep 1: Create a repository in your GitHub account\rOnce you have set up your GitHub account, create a new repository.\n\rStep 2: in R studio, create a project using version control\rNow working on the local machine.\nCreate a project from R studio by following this sequence of clicks: File \u0026gt; New Project \u0026gt; Version Control \u0026gt; Git. You will end up with a window below\n\rRepository URL: copy the URL site from your repository in the GitHub here.\rProject Reposition Name: put down directory name you want to call here. This is the working folder that hold your files.\rCreate Project as Subdirectory of: a folder you want to place under.\r\rOnce you click Create Project, the repository in your GitHub will be cloned to the folder in local machine. But it is still empty. Next step is to build a web site files using hugo academic theme within the folder just created. Run the R statement below, a static web site will be generated as a result.\n# for example, create a new site with the academic theme\rblogdown::new_site(theme = \u0026quot;gcushen/hugo-academic\u0026quot;, theme_example = TRUE)\rThen, go to menu Addins \u0026gt; Serve site. You will see a website is created in the Viewer panel on the right panel.\nBut this is a template which does not show your name and your blogs. You need to update them based on the temlpate files, YOu change site name, menu, contact information to make it become your web site. Below is a minimal set of files you need to update.\nChange biography section and update the Picture: Go to content \u0026gt; author \u0026gt; admin folder and open _index.md file to update your biography including education, email address, organization, and short biography. In the same folder, change the avatar.jpg to your picture\rChange the contact information: Go to **Config \u0026gt; _default** folder. Open Params.toml and update the email, contact, phone for yours.\rDelete contents. If you do not want to display talks you have given, go to content \u0026gt; home folder, Open file talks.md and edit the yaml header by setting value of Active from True to False. Sections like Publications can be made to disappear in the same way.\rremove the Banner above the menu. Go to content \u0026gt; home folder and open file hero.md. Edit toml file heard by resetting the value of Active to False.\r\rWith above changes, the web site will have you name, picture, and biography. so, you become the owner of the web site. Now, you can push the contents to your GitHub repository in your GitHub account.\n\rStep 3: Push contents back to your GitHub account\rin the RStudio terminal folder, run below statement sequentially.\ngit add .\rgit commit -m \u0026#39;your comment about change\u0026#39;\rgit push origin master\r\rStep 4: Deploy contents to Netlify\rGo to the Netlify https://www.netlify.com/. Since this site allows you to deploy your content directly from GitHub, you do not even need to set up account in Netlify. With the site, you will see the page as below\nMake sure that you check the GitHub.\nOnce your site is deployed, Netlify will assign a random name to your subdomain like random-word-12345.netlify.com. You can change the random text to a more meaningful text. For example, I changed the random text to be my name: dongsuncao so that my site address will be end up being http://dongsuncao.netlify.com.\nThen your site is live. You can access the site from anywhere and anytime.\n\rRecap:\rThe steps I described here are a simplified but working procedure, but it allows you to create and deploy your web site in shortest possible time. For each step, there may be other ways to do it. This is very important when you encounter an issue, You have choices to get around the hurdle. For example, to upload the contents to the GitHub account, you can simply go to Tool \u0026gt; version control \u0026gt;commit. then you add file you want to commit, once it is done, simply use Push button to upload the files to GitHub.\nTo completely own the site, you need to work on more files. For example, to post a blog, you can click on the Addins and click on the new post.\n\rBeyond the basics\rIf you want to learn more, please read Allisonâ€™s blog https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/ and doumention in GitHub https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/tree/master/docs\n\r\r","date":1548547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548547200,"objectID":"9d6517ed2129f6b6d42868dc44d5d153","permalink":"/post/create-a-web-site/","publishdate":"2019-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/create-a-web-site/","section":"post","summary":"Get Started:\rPutting up your personal web site in the internet is everyoneâ€™s dream.

Due to its complexity, it often represents a great challenge to conduct an efficient and effective review.  JMPÂ® has been proven to be a powerful interactive visualization tool in analyzing clinical data.  This paper describes the development of JMPÂ® Add-in Lab Analyzer using JSL, which takes ADaM datasets as input and allows interactive visualization and customized analysis of Laboratory data.  The analysis approaches are based on the FDA reviewer guidance on lab data, including measures of central tendency, outliers or shifts from normal to abnormal, and marked outliers as well as exploratory lab data analysis such as Hyâ€™s Law.  The Lab Analyzer takes advantage of the powerful visualization capability of JMPÂ® and uses a variety of graphs such as scatter plots, box plots, and scatter matrices to enable reviewers to quickly identify outliers, to detect data patterns, and to drill down to the patient level by viewing individual profiles. Standard summary reports on measures of central tendency, shift tables in both interactive tabular and PDF format are incorporated.","tags":[],"title":"Using JMPÂ® Scripting Language (JSL) To Create An Application Interface For Automated Analysis Of Lab Data In Clinical Trial","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n\r\rSlides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target.

From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne\r Two\r Three\r\nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
