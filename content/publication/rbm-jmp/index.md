abstract: We take advantage of a platform provided by JMP and report development of a user-friendly application interface KRI analyzer. It automates analysis of KRIs by intergrating different sources of data from multiple studies, applyling analytics to uncover the data patterns, anomalies, and trend in the clincal studies, allowing for visualization of KRIs in a dynamical and intercvie way.
abstract_short: An application interface was developed using JMP scripting language. This user-friendly application interface KRI analyzer automates analysis of KRIs by intergrating different sources of data from multiple studies, applyling analytics to uncover the data patterns, anomalies, and trend in the clincal studies, allowing for visualization of KRIs in a dynamical and intercvie way.
