abstract: Laboratory data is the key element of the safety profile in drug development. Due to its complexity, it often represents a great challenge to conduct an efficient and effective review.  JMP® has been proven to be a powerful interactive visualization tool in analyzing clinical data.  This paper describes the development of JMP® Add-in Lab Analyzer using JSL, which takes ADaM datasets as input and allows interactive visualization and customized analysis of Laboratory data.  The analysis approaches are based on the FDA reviewer guidance on lab data, including measures of central tendency, outliers or shifts from normal to abnormal, and marked outliers as well as exploratory lab data analysis such as Hy’s Law.  The Lab Analyzer takes advantage of the powerful visualization capability of JMP® and uses a variety of graphs such as scatter plots, box plots, and scatter matrices to enable reviewers to quickly identify outliers, to detect data patterns, and to drill down to the patient level by viewing individual profiles. Standard summary reports on measures of central tendency, shift tables in both interactive tabular and PDF format are incorporated.
